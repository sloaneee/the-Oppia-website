Journey
User Research and Pilot
OPPIA recently conducted a pilot program in government primary schools in Eti-Osa LGA, Lagos, Nigeria. The pilot involved students from primary 4, 5, and 6, who were divided into sets and participated in various sessions, including diagnosis, pre-test, learning with the Oppia app, and post-test.

The pilot was impactful, and students showed enthusiasm for learning with the Oppia lessons application. The feedback from stakeholders, including the Education Secretary, the school's Headmaster, teachers, and students, was overwhelmingly positive.

User Feedback
After the pilot, students shared their experiences with Oppia:

Ogechi: "I like using Oppia because it teaches me first before giving me the quiz."
Happiness: "I can go back and learn when I don't know how to answer a question correctly. My teacher taught me another formula for a fraction, but I have seen a new formula in Oppia."
Anthony: "For place value, my teacher calls the ones place unit, but this app calls it ones."
Promise: "Oppia has new topics that I have not learned yet."
Happiness: "My teacher taught me that the place value of the last number is called Unit, but Oppia lesson calls it Ones."
