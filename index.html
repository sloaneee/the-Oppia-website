                  <p>This blog post recounts my experience carrying out a user research and go-to-market exercise for 
                    the Oppia lessons web and mobile application in government primary schools in Eti-Osa LGA, Lagos, Nigeria.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I paid a visit to Olumo Primary School where I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Solomon, the assistant Headmaster. 
                    During our meeting, I introduced the Oppia lessons app to him, elaborated on the goals and mission of the Oppia foundation, and presented our proposal seeking his consent to run a pilot with some students. 
                    Mr. Solomon informed me that I needed the approval of the Education secretary of the local government to carry out the pilot in the school. 
                    Subsequently, I proceeded to meet with the Education secretary where I submitted my proposal and it was approved.
                  </p>
                  <p>The pilot was conducted with students from primary 4, 5, and 6. The students were divided into 3 sets, Primary 4, 5 and 6. And the exercise was divided into 4 sessions, Diagnosis session, Pre-test session, 
                    Learning with the Oppia app and Post test session. The devices used for the pilot were 2 mobile phones, where the Oppia android app was installed and one laptop, for the Oppia web application.</p>
                  <p>The devices were shared among the students, with two students sharing one device. Although they learned together with the devices, each student answered the questions independently.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I introduced the app to the students and explained how the session would run, and they were excited to begin. 
                    The first task assigned to them was the diagnostic test, which is a survey that helped to figure out which topic each student should be learning. 
                    Each set completed the test in an average time of 12 minutes. The link to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZM-gj4bZWSnaGnLudmI7YKbb2FcJtAMF?usp=sharing">result</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>Next was the pre-test, the pre-test was used to test and record the level of knowledge the students have of a selected Maths topic. 
                    The pre-test topics for each student was determined by the topic they performed the least in the Diagnosis test. 
                    Each set completed the test  in an average time of 15 minutes, Here’s the link to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZM-gj4bZWSnaGnLudmI7YKbb2FcJtAMF?usp=sharing">result</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The learning session began after the students completed the pre-test. The topic assigned to each student was determined by the topic they performed the least in the Diagnosis test. 
                    Each set completed the learning session in an average time of 25 minutes. The link to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZM-gj4bZWSnaGnLudmI7YKbb2FcJtAMF?usp=sharing">result</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, the post-test was administered, and each student finished it in an average time of 15 minutes. 
                    <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZM-gj4bZWSnaGnLudmI7YKbb2FcJtAMF?usp=sharing">result</a>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After the Pilot ended, I asked the student to tell me what they liked about learning with the Oppia lessons application, these were their responses.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Ogechi: I like using Oppia because it teaches me first before giving me the quiz.</li>
                      <li>Happiness: I can go back and learn when I don't know how to answer a question correctly. My teacher taught me another formula for fraction but I have seen a new formula in Oppia.</li>
                      <li>Anthony: For place value, my teacher calls the ones place unit, but this app calls it ones.</li>
                      <li>Promise: This Oppia has new topics that I have not learned yet.</li>
                      <li>Happiness: My teacher taught me that the place value of the last number is called Unit, but this Oppia lesson calls it Ones.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The impact of Oppia can continue on an ongoing basis</h2>
                    <p>The Oppia lesson app received a warm reception from various stakeholders, including the Education Secretary, the School's Headmaster, the teachers, and the students. 
                      The Education Secretary commended the Oppia lesson application as a welcomed development and appreciated that it was free, the Assistant Headmaster also praised the initiative, stating that it would be highly appreciated by teachers, students, and parents.</p>
                    <p>The research pilot was Impactful and the students benefited from learning with the Oppia lessons application.

                    </p>
                    <p>Most children do not have access to high-quality education and are unaware of the benefits of e-learning.These are some of the issues the Oppia foundation is attempting to address on a broader scale 
                      by translating the lessons into local languages for better comprehension and making the features very understandable with little or no supervision, allowing our target audience to easily adopt the technology.
